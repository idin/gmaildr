### Data Export & Visualization
- [ ] **Export Functionality**: CSV/Excel export for analysis results
- [ ] **Visualization**: Charts and graphs for email analysis

### System & Infrastructure
- [ ] **Configuration Management**: Config file for settings

- [x] **Documentation**: User documentation and examples for human email detection
- [ ] **Performance Profiling**: Identify and fix bottlenecks
- [ ] **Error Logging**: Proper logging system
- [x] **Caching**: Intelligent caching for repeated operations
- [x] **Modular Architecture**: Organized code into focused modules
- [ ] **Async Processing**: Async/await for better performance
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for custom analyzers

- [x] **Advanced Analytics**: Human email detection with multi-dimensional analysis
- [ ] **Machine Learning**: ML-based email classification for improved accuracy
- [ ] **Parallel Computing of Metrics**: Use multi-threading or multi-processing to measure metrics

### Known Issues & Bugs
- [ ] **Progress Bar Accuracy**: Sometimes shows 94-96% instead of 100% due to retry logic
- [ ] **Kernel Crashes**: Parallel text extraction can cause Jupyter kernel crashes with large datasets
- [ ] **Text Extraction Failures**: Some emails fail to extract text due to API errors
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Large email datasets can consume significant memory
- [ ] **API Rate Limiting**: Gmail API has strict rate limits that can slow processing
- [x] **API Access Counters**: Track Gmail API access counts (general and text-specific)
- [x] **Parallel Text Analysis**: Verify if text analysis is actually running in parallel
- [x] **Zero Metrics Issue**: Fixed HTML-based metrics to use proper EmailContentAnalyzer parsing

### API Design Issues & Improvements Needed
- [ ] **Elegant Email Operations**: Current API requires DataFrame â†’ column â†’ list conversion, needs more elegant methods
- [ ] **Label vs Folder Semantics**: Should treat trash/inbox/archive as folders, not labels for better user experience
- [ ] **Single vs List Parameters**: `remove_labels=['TRASH']` should be `remove_labels='TRASH'` for single items
- [ ] **Method Chaining**: Enable fluent API design for email operations
- [ ] **Direct Email Operations**: Methods that work directly on email objects, not just IDs
- [ ] **Folder-Specific Methods**: Dedicated methods like `move_to_trash()`, `move_to_archive()`, `move_to_inbox()`

### Human Email Detection Issues & Limitations
- [ ] **Language Support**: Limited to English language patterns, needs multi-language support
- [ ] **False Positives**: Well-written automated emails may be classified as human
- [ ] **False Negatives**: Formal business emails may be classified as automated
- [ ] **Behavioural Analysis**: Limited behavioural scoring (only attachment presence)
- [ ] **Thread Analysis**: No conversation flow analysis or reply chain detection
- [ ] **Sending Time Analysis**: No analysis of irregular vs scheduled sending patterns
- [ ] **Subject Variation**: No analysis of subject line patterns and variation
- [ ] **Custom Training**: No user-specific training or customization capabilities
- [ ] **Performance**: Large datasets may be slow due to regex pattern matching
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Text analysis can consume significant memory for large email collections

### Test Failures & Bugs to Fix

## ðŸ”§ Usage Examples

### Basic Email Retrieval
```python
# Basic email retrieval
df = gmail.get_emails(days=30)

# With text content and metrics
df = gmail.get_emails(
    days=30, 
    include_text=True, 
    include_metrics=True,
    use_batch=True
)
```

### Human Email Detection
```python
from gmaildr.analysis import detect_human_emails, get_human_sender_summary

# Detect human emails
human_emails_df = detect_human_emails(
    emails_df=df,
    human_threshold=0.6
)

# Get summary statistics
summary = get_human_sender_summary(human_emails_df)

# Filter human vs automated senders
human_senders = human_emails_df[human_emails_df['is_human_sender'] == True]
automated_senders = human_emails_df[human_emails_df['is_human_sender'] == False]
```

### Sender Analysis
```python
# Group by sender with comprehensive metrics
sender_counts = df.groupby('sender_email', as_index=False).agg({
    'message_id': ('count', 'num_messages'),
    'has_attachments': ('sum', 'num_attachments'),
    'size_kb': ('sum', 'total_size_kb'),
    'date_received': ('min', 'earliest_date'),
    'date_received': ('max', 'latest_date'),
    'in_inbox': ('sum', 'inbox_count'),
    'in_archive': ('sum', 'archive_count'),
    'in_trash': ('sum', 'trash_count'),
    'in_spam': ('sum', 'spam_count'),
    'in_sent': ('sum', 'sent_count'),
    'in_drafts': ('sum', 'drafts_count'),
    'has_attachments': ('sum', 'has_attachments_count')
})
```
